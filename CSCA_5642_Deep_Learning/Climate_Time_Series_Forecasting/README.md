The dataset I chose for my final project includes weather data from Jan 10, 2009 - December 31, 2016 from a weather station in Jena, Germany. The data is reported every 10 minutes between that 7-year period. Weather data includes columns such as humidity, temperature, vapor pressure, and wind speed.

The goal of my final project is to leverage RNNs to forecast the temperature in 2016 by training on the weather data before 2016.
