The goal of this problem is to predict whether tweets are real disasters or not based on their text, keyword about their content, and location (all text columns). There is also a unique id column in both datasets. There are a total of 10000 tweets, 7613 of which are in the train dataset with known labels. There are missing values for keyword and location:
* About 1/3 values are NA for location.
* Under 1% are NA for keyword.
