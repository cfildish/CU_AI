I'm Something of a Painter Myself consists of 
* 7028 photos and 
* 300 monet paintings

Each image being 256x256x3. The goal of this project is to use GANs to create Monet-like paintings of the real photos. This will be done by creating a generator that creates predictions (monet-like photos) and a discriminator that compares the predicted photos and monet photos and predicts which it thinks is real.
